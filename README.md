# Unity-Web3-MetaMask-Polygon-Plugin
This Unity Web3 plugin enables developers to integrate a seamless Web3 workflow into Unity, connecting a user's MetaMask wallet and loading Polygon NFTs from a specified contract. 
The demo operates on the Amoy Polygon Testnet, providing a testing environment to interact with NFTs directly within Unity. Future updates will expand functionality to support multiple contracts and wallet options, making it a versatile tool for blockchain integration in Unity projects.
